Chatbot assists users with selecting styles, colors, sizes, and printing options, answering FAQs, and log support requests.

## Run application

Before launching an application it is important to set the LANGCHAIN_API_KEY and credentials for Firebase service.

### Lang Smith
[Create a project](https://smith.langchain.com) and create an API key in settings

### Firebase

In the project create a collection (no matter which one just create), otherwise you could get an error.
Project Settings -> Generate a new private key
Upload the key into credentials folder and rename it to serviceAccountKey.json
